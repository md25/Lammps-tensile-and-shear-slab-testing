# Lammps Tensile and Shear Slab Testing

This repository contains scripts and input files for performing tensile and shear slab tests using LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator). The aim is to provide a reproducible workflow for running atomistic simulations focused on mechanical properties in slab geometries.

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Tensile and shear testing on atomic slabs in LAMMPS.
- **Status:** The related research paper is in progress.
- **Main functionalities:**  
  - Generation of slab geometries (with ASE)  
  - LAMMPS input and control scripts  
  - Post-processing tools for analyzing results

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov/) installed on your system
- [ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) for structure generation




## Repository Structure

- `ase/` : ASE structure generation scripts  
- `input/` : Example LAMMPS input files
